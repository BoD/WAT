# WAT (Windows And Tabs)

A browser extension to help manage windows and tabs.

- A popup shows the list of all your open windows, as well as the ones you have saved.
- A save button allows you to save windows so they can be restored later.
- Clicking on a window will restore it (if not already opened) or focus it.

That's it!

## Get it

- Chrome: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wat/fdpacoplkcilgncmbfakgjddjiekfdmp)
- Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wat/)

## Acknowledgements

This extension is inspired by [Tabs Outliner](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabs-outliner/eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl?hl=en)
while trying to keep it simpler. Also, WAT works with Firefox, while Tabs Outliner is Chrome only.
